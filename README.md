# Mini-Twitter
This program is a simple text-based social media app.
It stores users in a dictionary and posts in a list, with each post given a unique ID. The main menu lets the user choose what action to perform.
Users can create an account with a username and bio. Posts can only be created by existing users and are saved with an ID, author, text, and like count. The feed displays all posts with their details. Users can like a post by entering its ID, which increases the like count. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
